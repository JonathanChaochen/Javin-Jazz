                <h2>John Crawford: Times And Tides</h2>

                <p><img class="author_photo" src="images/author/MARK_SULLIVAN.jpg" alt="Mark Sullivan">By <span class="author_name">MARK SULLIVAN</span> <br>

                <p><img class="pic_jazz" src="images/John.png" alt="John Crawford: Times and Tides">Blurred" shares a Brazilian heritage with the cover of Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Once I Loved" that follows it. Guitarist Guillermo Hill makes an immediate impression on nylon-string guitar: he's an effective foil to Crawford's piano. The Jobim tune also features sultry vocalist Linley Weir and saxophonist Duncan Lamont Snr.
                </p>

                <p>"Solea por Brixton" (the solea is one of the most basic Flamenco forms) puts a spotlight on drummer Simon Pearson and percussionist Andres Ticino. "Gabriel's Message" changes things up with a traditional Basque folk song, also a great percussion workout. "Nini" makes a Latin jazz tune out of Antonin Dvořák's "Slavonic Dance No. 2," with lyrics by featured vocalist Eleonora Claps. Remarkable how well the tune fits this new rhythmic setting. </p>

                <p>Pat Metheny's "James" gets an exciting new arrangement, with Hill's guitar playing again a particular standout, as well as a contrapuntal guitar/piano duet. The final cover is an inspired choice: "Cono" by the great Malian singer Salif Keita, from his debut album Soro (Mango, 1987). A beautiful tune, with an Afropop groove that fits right in with the Latin ones—and it also provides bassist Richard Sadler a great setting for a solo. Crawford's "Endgame" features one last guest, lyrical flugelhornist Shanti Paul Jayasinha. </p>

                <p>A very fresh take on Latin jazz. Crawford's Quintet is a hot band, and the guest musicians each contribute something special without dominating the sound.</p>

                <p>Track Listing: Blurred; Once I Loved; Solea por Brixton; Gabriel's Message; Nini; Miriam's Last Journey; James; Cono; Endgame.</p>
